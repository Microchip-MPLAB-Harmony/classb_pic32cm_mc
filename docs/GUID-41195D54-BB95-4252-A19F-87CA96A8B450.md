# CLASSB_Startup_Tests
**Function**

```c
static CLASSB_STARTUP_STATUS CLASSB_Startup_Tests(void);
```

**Summary**

This function executes all startup self-tests inserted into classb.c file by the MHC.

**Description**

This function is called from the '_on_reset' function which is the first function to be executed after a reset.
If none of the self-tests are failed, this function returns 'CLASSB_STARTUP_TEST_PASSED'.
If any of the startup self-tests are failed, this function will not return. The self-tests for SRAM,
Clock and Interrupt are considered non-critical since it may be possible to execute a fail-safe function
after detecting a failure. In such case, the CLASSB_SelfTest_FailSafe() function is called when a failure
is detected. In the case of critical failures (CPU registers or internal flash), the corresponding self-test
remains in an infinite loop to avoid unsafe execution of code.

**Precondition**

None.

**Parameters**

None.

**Returns**

Pass or Fail.

**Example**

```c
CLASSB_STARTUP_STATUS startup_tests_status = CLASSB_STARTUP_TEST_FAILED;
startup_tests_status = CLASSB_Startup_Tests();
```

**Remarks**

This function does not return if any of the self-tests detects a failure.
