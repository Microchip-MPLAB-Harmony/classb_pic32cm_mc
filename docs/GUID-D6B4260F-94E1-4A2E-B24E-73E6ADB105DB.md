# CLASSB_SST_WDT_Recovery
**Function**

```c
static void CLASSB_SST_WDT_Recovery(void);
```

**Summary**

This function is called if a WDT reset is caused while a startup self-test is running.

**Description**

This function is used inside the CLASSB_Init() function. When the device comes back from a WDT reset,
if there has been a startup self-test running, it is assumed that the WDT reset has happened because
a Class B self-test has taken more time that the WDT timeout period. In this case, the
CLASSB_SST_WDT_Recovery() function is called from CLASSB_Init().

**Precondition**

None.

**Parameters**

None.

**Returns**

None.

**Example**

```c
if ((RSTC_REGS->RSTC_RCAUSE & RSTC_RCAUSE_WDT_Msk) == RSTC_RCAUSE_WDT_Msk)
{
    if (*classb_test_in_progress == CLASSB_TEST_STARTED)
    {
        CLASSB_SST_WDT_Recovery();
    }
}
```

**Remarks**

This function is for the internal use of the Class B library.
